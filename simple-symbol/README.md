The Simple Symbol Programming Language
======================================

# Introduction

## Overview

This is the first programming language that I write. After completing the [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/Irides-Chromium/compiler/bf_interpreter/) and some further extensions, I discover that writing a interpreter like that isn't that hard. Unlike languages like C, it has only one byte for every instruction instead of `char`, for example. So, inspired by brainfuck, I want to write a language myself, and I try to make it as simple as brainfuck, but not that *brainfuck*. It currently has about 25 operators (they are all symbols), two tapes (extendable up to 8), and one special register, but it is still undergoing an improvement and the design hasn't complete yet at this moment.

## Operators (commands)

1. `~`
